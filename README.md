# EPCOT weather

my second flutter project, the first one i put my back into.

* significant co-writing performed by github copilot
* used material design asthetic and controls
* uses system theme for light/dark
* displays current weather at EPCOT (note that the service i'm using updates every 15 minutes)
* button to switch theme
* button to reload (again, server updates data every 15 minutes. app does not auto-refetch)
* hourly forecast ribbon/horizontal scroller for the remainder of the day, including sunrise/sunset markers, if relevant
* switches day/night icons
* displays additional information for current conditions (wind, humidity, pressure)
